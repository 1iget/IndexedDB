        This document defines APIs for a database of records holding simple values
        and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key and some value.
        Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records it stores. An
        application developer directly uses an API to locate records either by
        their key or by using an index. A query language can be layered on this
        API. An indexed database can be implemented using a persistent B-tree data
        structure.

      <section id="user-tracking" class="section">
        <h3>User tracking</h3>

        <p>
          A third-party host (or any object capable of getting content
          distributed to multiple sites) could use a unique identifier
          stored in its client-side database to track a user across multiple
          sessions, building a profile of the user's activities. In conjunction
          with a site that is aware of the user's real id object (for
          example an e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials),
          this could allow oppressive groups to target individuals with
          greater accuracy than in a world with purely anonymous Web usage.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the
          risk of user tracking:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Blocking third-party storage</dt>
          <dd>
            User agents MAY restrict access to the database objects
            to scripts originating at the domain of the top-level document of
            the <span>browsing context</span>, for instance denying access to
            the API for pages from other domains running in <code>iframe</code>s.
          </dd>

          <dt>Expiring stored data</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents MAY automatically delete stored data after a period
            of time.</p>

            <p>This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the
            site would then only be able to track the user across multiple
            sessions when he authenticates with the site itself (e.g. by
            making a purchase or logging in to a service).</p>

            <p>However, this also puts the user's data at risk.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Treating persistent storage as cookies</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents should present the database feature
            to the user in a way that associates them strongly with HTTP
            session cookies. [[COOKIES]]</p>

            <p>This might encourage users to view such storage with healthy
            suspicion.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Site-specific white-listing of access to databases</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents MAY require the user to authorize access to
            databases before a site can use the feature.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Origin-tracking of stored data</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents MAY record the <span title="origin">origins</span>
            of sites that contained content from third-party origins that
            caused data to be stored.</p>

            <p>If this information is then used to present the view of data
            currently in persistent storage, it would allow the user to make
            informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage to
            prune. Combined with a blacklist ("delete this data and prevent
            this domain from ever storing data again"), the user can restrict
            the use of persistent storage to sites that he trusts.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Shared blacklists</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>User agents MAY allow users to share their persistent storage
            domain blacklists.</p>

            <p>This would allow communities to act together to protect their
            privacy.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this API for user
          tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single domain, a
          site can continue to track the user during a session, and can then
          pass all this information to the third party along with any
          identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses)
          obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple
          sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be
          created.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no
          cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using
          session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used for
          innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even
          retroactively). This information can then be shared with other
          sites, using using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific
          data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine
          separate sessions into coherent user profiles.

        <h3>Cookie resurrection</h3>

        <p>
          If the user interface for persistent storage presents data in the
          persistent storage features described in this specification
          separately from data in HTTP session cookies, then users are likely
          to delete data in one and not the other. This would allow sites to
          use the two features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a
          user's attempts to protect his privacy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="sensitivity-of-data" class="section">
        <h3>Sensitivity of data</h3>

        <p>
          User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially
          sensitive; it is quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments,
          health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this
          mechanism.
        </p>

        <p>To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data,
          it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.

      <section id="dns-spoofing-attacks" class="section">
        <h3>DNS spoofing attacks</h3>

        <p>
          Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot
          guarantee that a host claiming to be in a certain domain really is
          from that domain. To mitigate this, pages can use SSL. Pages using
          SSL can be sure that only pages using SSL that have certificates
          identifying them as being from the same domain can access their
          databases.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="cross-directory-attacks" class="section">
        <h3>Cross-directory attacks</h3>

        <p>
          Different authors sharing one host name, for example users
          hosting content on <code>geocities.com</code>, all share one
          set of databases.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no feature to restrict the access by pathname. Authors on
          shared hosts are therefore recommended to avoid using these
          features, as it would be trivial for other authors to read the data
          and overwrite it.
        </p>

        <p class="note">Even if a path-restriction feature was made
          available, the usual DOM scripting security model would make it
          trivial to bypass this protection and access the data from any
          path.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="implementation-risks" class="section">
        <h3>Implementation risks</h3>

        <p>The two primary risks when implementing these persistent storage
        features are letting hostile sites read information from other
        domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is then
        read from other domains.</p>

        <p>Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be
        read from their domain causes <em>information leakage</em>, For
        example, a user's shopping wish list on one domain could be used by
        another domain for targeted advertising; or a user's
        work-in-progress confidential documents stored by a word-processing
        site could be examined by the site of a competing company.</p>

        <p>Letting third-party sites write data to the persistent storage of
        other domains can result in <em>information spoofing</em>, which is
        equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add records to a
        user's wish list; or a hostile site could set a user's session
        identifier to a known ID that the hostile site can then use to track
        the user's actions on the victim site.</p>

        <p>Thus, strictly following the <span>origin</span> model described
        in this specification is important for user security.</p>
