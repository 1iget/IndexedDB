        This document defines APIs for a database of records holding simple 
        values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key and some 
        value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records it stores. 
        An application developer directly uses an API to locate records either 
        by their key or by using an index. A query language can be layered on 
        this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a persistent 
        B-tree data structure.

            within a specific <a>origin</a>. The name can be any string value, including the empty string, and
            stays constant for the lifetime of the database. Each <a>database</a> also has a current
            <dfn>version</dfn>. When a database is first created, its <a>version</a> is the empty string.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Implementations MUST support all names. If a implementation
            uses a storage mechanism which can't handle arbitrary database names,
            the implementation must use an escaping mechanism or something similar
            to map the provided name to a name that it can handle.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Each <a>database</a> has one version at a time; a <a>database</a> 
            can't exist in multiple versions at once. The only way to change the version is using a VERSION_CHANGE
            <a>transaction</a>.

          <p>
            Databases has a <dfn>delete pending</dfn> flag which is used during deletion. When a database is requested
            to be deleted the flag is set to true and all attempts at opening the database are stalled until the database

          <p>
            The act of opening a <a>database</a> creates a <dfn>connection</dfn>. There MAY be multiple

          <h4>Object Store</h4>
          <p>
            An <dfn>object store</dfn> is the primary storage mechanism for storing data in a
            <a>database</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each database contain a set of <a>object store</a>s. The set of <a>object store</a>s
            can be changed, but can only be changed using a VERSION_CHANGE transactions. When a new database is
            created it doesn't contain any <a>object store</a>s and has the empty string as <a>version</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The object store has a <a title="object store record list">list of records</a> which hold the
            data stored in the object store. Each <dfn>record</dfn> consists of a <dfn>key</dfn> and a <dfn>value</dfn>.
            The list is sorted according to key in ascending order. There can never be multiple records in a given object
            store with the same key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every <a>object store</a> has a <dfn title="object store name">name</dfn>.
            The name is unique within the <a>database</a> to which it belongs. Every object store also optionally has a
            <a>key generator</a> and a optional <dfn title="object store key path">key path</dfn>.
            If the object store has a key path it is said to use <dfn>in-line keys</dfn>. Otherwise it is said to
            use <dfn>out-of-line</dfn> keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            The object store can derive the <a>key</a> from one of three sources. Which source is used is determined
            when the object store is created. The three sources are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A <dfn>key generator</dfn>. A key generator generates a monotonically increasing numbers every time
              a key is needed.
              <p class="issue">
                specify that generators are not shared between stores.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              A <dfn>key path</dfn>. A key path points to a property in a given <a>value</a>. When a object store uses a
              <a>key path</a> to generate keys, the key is the property in the stored <a>value</a> pointed to by the
              <a>key path</a>.
              <p class="issue">
                Need to specify how a key path is parsed and how a "evaluated" against a value. Including the requirement
                that the value needs to be a object and that the property must be enumerated.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Keys can also be explicitly specified when a <a>value</a> is stored in the object store.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Keys</h4>
          <p>
            In order to efficiently retrieve <a>record</a>s stored in an indexed database,
            each <a>record</a> is organized according to its key. A value is said to be a <dfn>valid key</dfn>
            if it is one of the following types: IDL data types
            <code>DOMString</code>, <code>long</code>, and <code>float</code> [[!WEBIDL]]; or the
            <code>Date</code> JavaScript object [[!ECMA-262]].
            Additionally, if the value os of type <code>float</code>, it is only a <a>valid key</a> if it is not NaN.
            <a>Conforming user agents</a> MUST support all <a>valid key</a>s as keys.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Inifinite <code>float</code> values are <a>valid key</a>s.
          </p>
          <p>
            For purposes of comparison, all <code>DOMString</code> values are evaluated as greater than 
            <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>Date</code> values; <code>Date</code> values are evaluated as greater than <code>long</code> 
            and <code>float</code> values; and <code>long</code> and <code>float</code> values are evaluated by their numeric 
            value with no need to separate them by type. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms <dfn>greater than</dfn>, <dfn>less than</dfn> and <dfn>equal to</dfn> is defined in the terms of
            the above comparisons.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Only data types with natural ordering can be used as keys. 
            The ECMAScript <code>undefined</code> MUST NOT be used as a key.

          <h4>Index</h4>
          <p>
            It is sometimes useful to retreive <a>records</a> in a <a>object store</a> through other means
            than their <a>key</a>. A <dfn>index</dfn> allows looking up <a>record</a>s in a <a>object store</a>
            using properties of the <a>value</a>s in the <a>object store</a>s <a>record</a>s.
          </p>
          <p>
            An index is a specialized persistent key-value storage and has a <dfn>referenced</dfn> <a>object store</a>.
            The index has a <dfn title="index record list">list of records</dfn> which hold the
            data stored in the index. The records in an index are automatically populated whenever records in the
            <a>referenced</a> object store are inserted, updated or deleted. There can be several <a>index</a>es
            referencing the same <a>object store</a>, in which changes to the object store cause all such indexes
            to get updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The values in the index's <a>record</a>s are always values of <a>keys</a> in the index's <a>referenced</a>
            object store. The keys are derived from the referenced object store's <a>value</a>s using a <dfn title="index key path"><a>key path</a></dfn>.
            If a given <a>record</a> with key <var>X</var> in the object store referenced by the index has the value <var>A</var>, and
            <a title="evaluate key path">evaluting</a> the <a title="index key path">index's key path</a> on <var>A</var> yields the result
            <var>Y</var>, then the index will contain a record with key <var>Y</var> and value <var>X</var>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Records in an index are said to have a <dfn>referenced value</dfn>. This is the value of the record in the index's referenced
            object store which has a key equal to the index's record's value. So in the example above,
            the record in the index whose key is <var>Y</var> and value is <var>X</var> has a <a>referenced value</a> of <var>A</var>.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Each record in an index reference one and only one record in the index's <a>referenced</a> object store. However there can be
            multiple records in an index which reference the same record in the object store. And there can also be no records in an index
            which reference a given record in an object store.
          </p>
          <p class="issue">
            Some of the statements in the note are only true once we've implemented decisions made at TPAC.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a>record</a>s in an index are always sorted according to the <a>record</a>s key. However unlike object stores,
            a given index can contain multiple records with the same key. Such records are additionally sorted according to
            the records value.
          </p>
          <p>
            A index contains a <dfn>unique</dfn> flag. When this flag is set to true, the index enforces that no two <a>record</a>s
            in the index has the same key. If a <a>record</a> in the index's referenced object store is attempted to be inserted or
            modified such that evaluating the index's key path on the records new value yields a result which already exists in the
            index, then the attempted modification to the object store fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a><code>IDBIndex</code></a> and <a><code>IDBIndexSync</code></a> interfaces
            provide access to the metadata of an <a>index</a>. Note however that multiple instances of those
            interfaces representing the same <a>index</a> can exist.

          <h4>Transaction</h4>
          <p>
            A <dfn>transaction</dfn> is used to interact with the data in a <a>database</a>.
            Whenever data is read or written to the database this is done using a <a>transaction</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            All transactions are created using a <a>connection</a>.
            The transaction has a <a>mode</a> which determines which types of interactions can be performed
            using the transaction. The <a>mode</a> is set when the transaction is created and remains
            constant for the lifetime of the transaction. The transaction also has a <dfn>scope</dfn> which
            determines which <a>object store</a>s the transaction can interact with. Finally, transactions
            have a <dfn>active</dfn> flag, which determines if new <a>request</a>s can currently be placed
            against the transaction. Finally, transactions also contain a <dfn>request list</dfn> of
            <a>request</a>s which have been placed against the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transactions have a constant scope which is determined when the transaction is created and remains
            contant for the lifetime of the transaction.

          <p>
            <a title="transaction">Transactions</a> offer some protection from 
            application and system failures. A <a>transaction</a> may be used to
            store multiple data records or to conditionally modify certain data 
            records. A <a>transaction</a> represents an atomic and durable set 
            of data access and mutation operations. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <a title="transaction">Transactions</a> are expected to be short lived. This is encouraged
            using the automatically committing functionality described below. Authors can still cause
            transactions to run for a long time, however this is generally not a usage pattern which
            is recommended and can lead to bad user experience in some implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <dfn title="transaction lifetime">lifetime</dfn> of a <a>transaction</a> is as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A transaction is <dfn title="transaction create">created</dfn> using 
              <a class="idlType" href="#widl-IDBDatabase-transaction">IDBDatabase.transaction</a>.
              The arguments passed determine what the <a>scope</a> of the transaction is and whether it's read only or not.
              When a transaction is created its <a>active</a> flag is initially set to true.
            </li>
            <li>
              The implementation MUST allow <a>request</a>s to be <a title="place request">placed</a> against the transaction
              whenever the <a>active</a> flag is true. This is the case even if the transaction has not yet been
              <a title="transaction start">started</a>. Until the transaction is <a title="transaction start">started</a>
              the implementation MUST NOT execute these requests, but the implementation MUST still keep track of the
              <a>request</a>s and their order. Requests may only be placed against the transaction while the transaction
              is <a>active</a>. If a request is attempted to be placed against a transaction when it is not
              <a>active</a>, the implementation MUST reject the attempt by throwing a TRANSACTION_INACTIVE_ERR exception.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once an implementation is able to enforce the constraints defined for the <a>mode</a> of
              the transaction, defined below, the implementation MUST asynchronously
              <dfn title="transaction start">start</dfn> the transaction. When this happens is affected
              by the <a>mode</a> in which the transaction is opened, and which <a>object store</a>s are
              included in <a>scope</a> of the transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the transaction has been <a title="transaction start">started</a> the implementation can
              start executing the <a>request</a>s placed against the transaction. Unless otherwise defined requests
              MUST be executed in the order they are placed against the transaction. Likewise, their result MUST
              be returned in the order the request was placed against a specific transaction.
              There is no guarentee about the order that results from requests in different transactions are returned.
              Similarly, the isolation <a>mode</a> ensure that it doesn't matter which order requests placed against
              different transactions are executed.
            </li>
            <li>
              At any time a transaction can be <dfn>abort</dfn>ed, even if the transaction isn't currently
              <a>active</a>. When a transaction is aborted the implementation MUST undo (roll back) any changes
              made to the <a>database</a> using the transaction. This includes both changes to the contents of
              <a>object store</a>s as well as additions and removals of <a>object store</a>s and <a>index</a>es.
              <p class="note">
                A transaction can be aborted at any time before it is <a title="transaction finish">finished</a>.
                Including if it isn't <a>active</a> or hasn't yet
                <a title="transaction start">started</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once a transaction no longer can become <a>active</a>, and if the transaction
              hasn't been <a>abort</a>ed, the implementation MUST automatically attempt to
              <dfn title="commit">commit</dfn> it. This usually happens after all requests placed against the
              transaction has been executed and their returned results handled, but no new requests has been placed
              against the transaction. When a transaction is committed implementation MUST atomically write
              any changes to the <a>database</a> made by requests placed against the transaction. That is, either all
              of the changes MUST be written, or if an error occurs, such as a disk write error, the implementation
              MUST NOT write any of the changes to the database. If such an error occurs the implementation MUST
              <a>abort</a> the transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a transaction is <a>commit</a>ted or <a>abort</a>ed, it is said to be
              <def title="transaction finish">finished</def>. If a transaction can't be finished, for example
              due to the implementation crashing or the user taking some explicit action to cancel it, the
              implementation MUST <a>abort</a> the transaction.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Transactions are opened in one of three <dfn title="mode">modes</dfn>. The mode
            determine how concurrent access to <a>object store</a>s in the transaction is isolated.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><code><dfn>READ_ONLY</dfn></code></li>
            <li><code><dfn>READ_WRITE</dfn></code></li>
            <li><code><dfn>VERSION_CHANGE</dfn></code></li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The transaction <a>mode</a> determines both which operations are allowed to be performed
            during the transaction, as well whether two transactions can run concurrently or not.
            Which operations are allowed be be performed are defined in detail below, but in general
            transactions opened in <code><a>READ_ONLY</a></code> mode are only allowed to perform
            reading operations which does not change data. READ_WRITE transactions are allowed to
            perform reading and writing transactions to existing <a>object store</a>s, where as
            VERSION_CHANGE transactions are allowed to perform any operations, including ones that
            delete and create <a>object store</a>s and <a>index</a>es.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A VERSION_CHANGE transaction can never run concurrently with other transactions. When
            a VERSION_CHANGE transaction is created, the implementation MUST wait to
            <a title="transaction start">start</a> the VERSION_CHANGE transaction until no other transactions
            against the same <a>database</a> are running. As long as the VERSION_CHANGE transaction, the implementation
            MUST wait with <a title="transaction start">starting</a> any other transactions against the same <a>database</a>
            until the VERSION_CHANGE transaction is finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any number of transactions opened in <a>READ_ONLY</a> mode are allowed to run concurrently,
            even if the transaction's <a>scope</a> overlap and include the same <a>object store</a>s.
            As long as a READ_ONLY transaction is running, the data that the implementation returns
            through <a>request</a>s created with that transaction MUST remain
            constant. That is, two requests to read the same piece of data MUST yield the same result
            both for the case when data is found and the result is that data, and for the case when data
            is not found and a lack of data is indicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a number of ways that an implementation ensure this. It can prevent
            READ_WRITE transactions whose scope overlap the scope of the READ_ONLY transaction from
            starting until the READ_ONLY transaction is finished. Or it can allow the READ_ONLY
            transaction to see a snapshot of the contents of the <a>object store</a>s which is taken when
            the READ_ONLY transaction is started.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, implementations MUST ensure that a READ_WRITE transaction is only affected by
            changes to <a>object store</a>s that are made using the transaction itself. I.e. the
            implementation MUST ensure that another transaction does not modify the contents of
            <a>object store</a>s in the READ_WRITE transactions <a>scope</a>. The implementation
            MUST also ensure that if the READ_WRITE transaction completes successfully, that the
            changes written to <a>object store</a>s using the transaction can be comitted to the
            <a>database</a> without merge conflicts. An implementation MUST NOT abort a transaction
            due to merge conflicts.
          </p>
          <p>
            An implementation MUST NOT start any transaction until all other READ_WRITE transactions
            with overlapping <a>scope</a> have completed. When multiple transactions are
            eligible to be started, older transactions should be started first.
          </p>
          <p>
            User agents MUST ensure a reasonable level of fairness across transactions to prevent
            starvation. For example if multiple READ_ONLY transaction are started one after another
            the implementation MUST ensure that that doesn't indefinitely prevent a pending READ_WRITE
            transaction from <a title="transaction start">starting</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conforming user agents MUST automatically abort a <a>transaction</a> at
            the end of the scope in which it was created, if an exception is propagated to that scope.
          </p>

            Each reading and writing operation on a <a>database</a> is done using a <dfn>request</dfn>.
            Every request represents one read or write operation. <a>Request</a>s are always belong to
            a <a>transaction</a>. The only exception to this is the request created when a <a>connection</a>

            When a request is created, it is always <dfn title="place request">placed</dfn> against a

          <h4>Cursor</h4>
          <p>
            <a title="cursor">Cursors</a> are a transient mechanism used to 
            iterate over multiple records in a database. The storage operations
            are performed on the underlying <a>index</a> or an 
            <a>object store</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <dfn>cursor</dfn> comprises a <dfn>range</dfn> of records in either an <a>index</a>
            or an <a>object store</a>. The cursor has a <dfn title="cursor source">source</dfn> indicating
            which index or object store whose records it is iterating. A <a>cursor</a> maintains a <dfn>position</dfn> over 
            this series, which moves in a <dfn>direction</dfn> that is either 
            monotonically increasing or decreasing order of the <a>record</a> keys. Cursors
            also have a <dfn title="cursor key">key</dfn> and a <dfn title="cursor value">value</dfn>
            which represent the <a>key</a> and the <a>value</a> of the last iterated <a>record</a>.
            Cursors finally have a <dfn>got value</dfn> flag. When this flag is false, the cursor is either
            in the process of loading the next value or it has reached the end of its <a>range</a>, when it
            is true, it indicates that the cursor is currently holding a value and that it is ready to iterate
            to the next one.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <a title="cursor source">source</a> of a cursor is a <a>object store</a>, the <dfn>effective object store</dfn>
            of the cursor is that object store and the <dfn>effective key</dfn> of the cursor is the cursors <a>position</a>.
            If the <a title="cursor source">source</a> of a cursor is a <a>index</a>, the <a>effective object store</a>
            of the cursor is that index's <a>referenced</a> object store and the <a>effective key</a> is the cursors
            <a>object store position</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible for the list of records which the cursor is iterating over to
            change before the full <a>range</a> of the cursor has been iterated. In order to
            handle this, cursors maintain their <a>position</a> not as an index, but rather
            as a <a>key</a> of the previously returned record. For a forward iterating cursor,
            the next time the cursor is asked to iterate to the next record it returns the
            record with the lowest <a>key</a> <a>greater than</a> the one previously returned. For
            a backwards iterating cursor, the situation is opposite and it returns the record
            with the highest <a>key</a> <a>less than</a> the one previously returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            For cursors iterating indexes the situation is a little bit more complicated since
            multiple records can have the same key and are therefor also sorted by <a>value</a>.
            When iterating indexes the <a>cursor</a>'s also has a <dfn>object store position</dfn>, which indicates
            the <a>value</a> of the previously found <a>record</a> in the index. Both
            <a>position</a> and the <a>object store position</a> is used when finding the next appropriate record.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a title="cursor">Cursor</a> objects implement the <a><code>IDBCursor</code></a> 
            or the <a><code>IDBCursorSync</code></a> interfaces. There is only ever one
            <a><code>IDBCursor</code></a> or <a><code>IDBCursorSync</code></a> instance representing
            a given <a>cursor</a>. However there is no limit on how many cursors can be used at the
            same time.
