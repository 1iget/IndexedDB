        This document defines APIs for a database of records holding simple 
        values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key and some 
        value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records it stores. 
        An application developer directly uses an API to locate records either 
        by their key or by using an index. A query language can be layered on 
        this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a persistent 
        B-tree data structure.

          <h4>Database</h4>
          <p>
            Each <a>origin</a> has an associated set of 
            <a title="database">databases</a>. A <dfn>database</dfn> comprises
            one or more <a title="object store">object stores</a> which hold the data stored
            in the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every <a>database</a> has a <dfn title="database name">name</dfn> which identifies it
            within a specific <a>origin</a>. The name can be any string value, including the empty string, and
            stays constant for the lifetime of the database. Each <a>database</a> also has a current
            <dfn>version</dfn>. When a database is first created, its <a>version</a> is 0.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Implementations MUST support all names. If an implementation
            uses a storage mechanism which can't handle arbitrary database names,
            the implementation must use an escaping mechanism or something similar
            to map the provided name to a name that it can handle.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Each <a>database</a> has one version at a time; a <a>database</a> 
            can't exist in multiple versions at once. The only way to change the version is using a VERSION_CHANGE
            <a>transaction</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Databases has a <dfn>delete pending</dfn> flag which is used during deletion. When a database is requested
            to be deleted the flag is set to true and all attempts at opening the database are stalled until the database
            can be deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The act of opening a <a>database</a> creates a <dfn>connection</dfn>. There MAY be multiple 
            <a>connection</a>s to a given <a>database</a> at any given time. Each connection has a
            <dfn>closePending</dfn> flag which initially is set to false.

            or execution context where the <a>connection</a> is created is destroyed (for example due to the
            user navigating away from that page), the connection is closed. The connection can also be closed
            explicitly using the <a>steps for closing a database connection</a>. When the connection is closed
            the <a>closePending</a> flag is always set to true if it hasn't already been.

          <h4>Object Store</h4>
          <p>
            An <dfn>object store</dfn> is the primary storage mechanism for storing data in a
            <a>database</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each database contain a set of <a>object store</a>s. The set of <a>object store</a>s
            can be changed, but can only be changed using a VERSION_CHANGE transactions. When a new database is
            created it doesn't contain any <a>object store</a>s and has the empty string as <a>version</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The object store has a <a title="object store record list">list of records</a> which hold the
            data stored in the object store. Each <dfn>record</dfn> consists of a <dfn>key</dfn> and a <dfn>value</dfn>.
            The list is sorted according to key in ascending order. There can never be multiple records in a given object
            store with the same key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every <a>object store</a> has a <dfn title="object store name">name</dfn>.
            The name is unique within the <a>database</a> to which it belongs. Every object store also optionally has a
            <a>key generator</a> and an optional <dfn title="object store key path">key path</dfn>.
            If the object store has a key path it is said to use <dfn>in-line keys</dfn>. Otherwise it is said to
            use <dfn>out-of-line</dfn> keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            The object store can derive the <a>key</a> from one of three sources. Which source is used is determined
            when the object store is created. The three sources are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A <dfn>key generator</dfn>. A key generator generates a monotonically increasing numbers every time
              a key is needed.
              <p class="issue">
                specify that generators are not shared between stores.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Keys can be derived via a <a title="object store key path">key path</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keys can also be explicitly specified when a <a>value</a> is stored in the object store.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The <a><code>IDBObjectStore</code></a> and <a><code>IDBObjectStoreSync</code></a>
            interfaces represent an <a>object store</a>. Note however that multiple instances of those
            interfaces representing the same <a>object store</a> can exist.
          </p>

          <h4>Keys</h4>
          <p>
            In order to efficiently retrieve <a>record</a>s stored in an indexed database,
            each <a>record</a> is organized according to its <dfn>key</dfn>. A value is said to be a <dfn>valid key</dfn>
            if it is one of the following types: 
            <code>Array</code> JavaScript objects [[!ECMA-262]], <code>DOMString</code> [[!WEBIDL]],
            <code>Date</code> [[!ECMA-262]] or <code>float</code> [[!WEBIDL]].
            However <code>Array</code>s are only <a>valid key</a>s if every item in the array is defined and is
            a <a>valid key</a> (i.e. sparse arrays can not be <a>valid key</a>s).
            Any non-numeric properties are ignored, and thus does not affect if the <code>Array</code> is a <a>valid key</a>.
            Additionally, if the value is of type <code>float</code>, it is only a <a>valid key</a> if it is not NaN.
            <a>Conforming user agents</a> MUST support all <a>valid key</a>s as keys.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Infinite <code>float</code> values are <a>valid key</a>s. As are empty <code>Array</code>s.
          </p>
          <p>
            For purposes of comparison, all <code>Array</code>s are greater than all <code>DOMString</code>,
            <code>Date</code> and <code>float</code> values; all <code>DOMString</code> values are greater than all
            <code>Date</code> and <code>float</code> values; and all <code>Date</code> values are greater than all
            <code>float</code> values. Values of type <code>float</code> are compared to other <code>float</code> values
            numerically. Values of type <code>Date</code> are compared to other <code>Date</code> values chronologically.
            Values of type <code>DOMString</code> are compared to other values of type <code>DOMString</code> 
            by using the algorithm defined by step 4 of <cite>section 11.8.5, The Abstract Relational Comparison Algorithm</cite>, 
            of  the ECMAScript Language Specification [[!ECMA-262]].
            Values of type <code>Array</code> are compared to other values of type <code>Array</code> as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Let <var>A</var> be the first <code>Array</code> value and <var>B</var> be the second <code>Array</code>
              value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let <var>length</var> be the lesser of <var>A</var>'s length and <var>B</var>'s length.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let <var>i</var> be 0.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the <var>i</var>th value of <var>A</var> is <a>less than</a> the <var>i</var>th value of
              <var>B</var>, then <var>A</var> is less than <var>B</var>. Skip the remaining steps.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the <var>i</var>th value of <var>A</var> is <a>greater than</a> the <var>i</var>th value of
              <var>B</var>, then <var>A</var> is greater than <var>B</var>. Skip the remaining steps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increase <var>i</var> by 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>i</var> is not equal to <var>length</var>, go back to step 4. Otherwise continue to next step.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <var>A</var>'s length is less than <var>B</var>'s length, then <var>A</var> is less
              than <var>B</var>. If <var>A</var>'s length is greater than <var>B</var>'s length, then
              <var>A</var> is greater than <var>B</var>. Otherwise <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are equal.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="note">
            Note that <code>Array</code>s that contain other <code>Array</code>s are allowed as <a>valid key</a>s.
            In this case the algorithm above runs recursively when comparing the individual values in the arrays.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            As a result of the above rules, negative infinity is the lowest possible value for a key.
            There is no highest possible key value. 
            This is because an array of any candidate highest key followed by another valid key is even higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms <dfn>greater than</dfn>, <dfn>less than</dfn> and <dfn>equal to</dfn> is defined in the terms of
            the above comparisons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following examples illustrate the different behaviors when trying to use in-line <a>key</a>s and <a>key generator</a>s 
            to save an object to an <a>object store</a>.
          </p>
          <div class="example">       
            <p>If the following conditions are true:</p> 
              <ul>
                <li>This is the fourth entry in an <a>object store</a>.</li>
                <li>The <a>object store</a> has a <a>key generator</a>.</li>
                <li>There is no in-line value for the <a>key path</a> property.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Then the value provided by the <a>key generator</a> is used to populate the key value.  
                In the example below the <a>key path</a> for the object store is <code>"foo.bar"</code>.  
                The actual object has no value for the <code>bar</code> property, <code>{ foo: {} }</code>.  
                When the object is saved in the <a>object store</a> the <code>bar</code> property is assigned a value of 4 
                because that is the next <a>key</a> generated by the <a>object store</a>.
              </p>
            <codeblock>
 "foo.bar"
{ foo: {} }
            </codeblock>
            <p>If the following conditions are true:</p> 
              <ul>
                <li>This is the fourth entry in an <a>object store</a>.</li>
                <li>The <a>object store</a> has a <a>key generator</a>.</li>
                <li>There is a value for the <a>key path</a> property.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              Then the value associated with the <a>key path</a> property is used.  
              The auto-generated <a>key</a> is not used.  
              In the example below the <a>keypath</a> for the <a>object store</a> is <code>"foo.bar"</code>.  
              The actual object has a value of 10 for the <code>bar</code> property, <code>{ foo: { bar: 10} }</code>.  
              When the object is saved in the <a>object store</a> the <code>bar</code> property keeps its value of 10, because that is the <a>key value</a>.
            </p>
            <codeblock>
"foo.bar"
{ foo: { bar: 10 } }

              The following example illustrates the scenario when the specified in-line <a>key</a> is defined through a <a>key path</a> but there is no property matching it.  
              The value provided by the <a>key generator</a> is then used to populate the <a>key value</a> and the system is responsible 
              for creating as many properties as it requires to suffice the property dependencies on the hierarchy chain.  
              In the example below the <a>key path</a> for the <a>object store</a> is <code>"foo.bar.baz"</code>.  
              The actual object has no value for the <code>foo</code> property, <code>{ zip: {} }</code>.  
              When the object is saved in the <a>object store</a> the <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and <code>baz</code> properties 
              are created each as a child of the other until a value for <code>foo.bar.baz</code> can be assigned. 
              The value for <code>foo.bar.baz</code> is the next key generated by the object store.
            </p>
            <codeblock>
"foo.bar.baz"
{ zip: {} }
            </codeblock>
            <p>
              Attempting to store a property on a primitive value will fail and throw an error.  
              In the first example below the <a>key path</a> for the object store is <code>"foo"</code>.  
              The actual object is a primitive with the value, 4.  
              Trying to define a property on that primitive value fails.  
              The same is true for arrays.  Properties are not allowed on an array.  
              In the second example below, the actual object is an array, [10].  
              Trying to define a property on the array fails.
            </p>
            <codeblock>
// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path property on this primitive.
"foo"
4

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path property on this array.

          <h4>Index</h4>
          <p>
            It is sometimes useful to retrieve <a>records</a> in an <a>object store</a> through other means
            than their <a>key</a>. An <dfn>index</dfn> allows looking up <a>record</a>s in an <a>object store</a>
            using properties of the <a>value</a>s in the <a>object store</a>s <a>record</a>s.
          </p>
          <p>
            An index is a specialized persistent key-value storage and has a <dfn>referenced</dfn> <a>object store</a>.
            The index has a <dfn title="index record list">list of records</dfn> which hold the
            data stored in the index. The records in an index are automatically populated whenever records in the
            <a>referenced</a> object store are inserted, updated or deleted. There can be several <a>index</a>es
            referencing the same <a>object store</a>, in which changes to the object store cause all such indexes
            to get updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The values in the index's <a>record</a>s are always values of <a>keys</a> in the index's <a>referenced</a>
            object store. The keys are derived from the referenced object store's <a>value</a>s using a <dfn title="index key path"><a>key path</a></dfn>.
            If a given <a>record</a> with key <var>X</var> in the object store referenced by the index has the value <var>A</var>, and
            <a title="evaluate key path">evaluating</a> the <a title="index key path">index's key path</a> on <var>A</var> yields the result
            <var>Y</var>, then the index will contain a record with key <var>Y</var> and value <var>X</var>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Records in an index are said to have a <dfn>referenced value</dfn>. This is the value of the record in the index's referenced
            object store which has a key equal to the index's record's value. So in the example above,
            the record in the index whose key is <var>Y</var> and value is <var>X</var> has a <a>referenced value</a> of <var>A</var>.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Each record in an index reference one and only one record in the index's <a>referenced</a> object store. However there can be
            multiple records in an index which reference the same record in the object store. And there can also be no records in an index
            which reference a given record in an object store.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a>record</a>s in an index are always sorted according to the <a>record</a>s key. However unlike object stores,
            a given index can contain multiple records with the same key. Such records are additionally sorted according to
            the records value.
          </p>
          <p>
            An index contains a <dfn>unique</dfn> flag. When this flag is set to true, the index enforces that no two <a>record</a>s
            in the index has the same key. If a <a>record</a> in the index's referenced object store is attempted to be inserted or
            modified such that evaluating the index's key path on the records new value yields a result which already exists in the
            index, then the attempted modification to the object store fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            An index also contains a <dfn>multientry</dfn> flag. This flag affects how the index behaves when the result of evaluating
            the index's <a title="index key path">key path</a> yields an <code>Array</code>. If the <a>multientry</a> flag is false, then
            a single <a>record</a> whose <a>key</a> is an <code>Array</code> is added to the index. If the <a>multientry</a> flag is
            true, then the one <a>record</a> is added to the index for each item in the <code>Array</code>. The <a>key</a> for each
            record is the value of respective item in the <code>Array</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a><code>IDBIndex</code></a> and <a><code>IDBIndexSync</code></a> interfaces
            provide access to the metadata of an <a>index</a>. Note however that multiple instances of those
            interfaces representing the same <a>index</a> can exist.

          <h4>Transaction</h4>
          <p>
            A <dfn>transaction</dfn> is used to interact with the data in a <a>database</a>.
            Whenever data is read or written to the database it is done by using a <a>transaction</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            All transactions are created through a <a>connection</a>, which is the transaction's
            <dfn title="transaction connection">connection</dfn>.
            The transaction has a <a>mode</a> that determines which types of interactions can be performed
            upon that transaction. The <a>mode</a> is set when the transaction is created and remains
            fixed for the life of the transaction. The transaction also has a <dfn>scope</dfn> that
            determines the <a>object store</a>s with which the transaction may interact. Transactions
            have an <dfn>active</dfn> flag, which determines if new <a>request</a>s can be made
            against the transaction. Finally, transactions also contain a <dfn>request list</dfn> of
            <a>request</a>s which have been made against the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each transaction has a fixed scope, determined when the transaction is created. 
            A transaction's scope remains fixed for the lifetime of that transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a title="transaction">Transactions</a> offer some protection from 
            application and system failures. A <a>transaction</a> may be used to
            store multiple data records or to conditionally modify certain data 
            records. A <a>transaction</a> represents an atomic and durable set 
            of data access and data mutation operations. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <a title="transaction">Transactions</a> are expected to be short lived. This is encouraged
            by the <a title="commit">automatic committing</a> functionality described below. Authors can still cause
            transactions to run for a long time; however, this usage pattern 
            is not generally recommended as it can lead to a bad user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <dfn title="transaction lifetime">lifetime</dfn> of a <a>transaction</a> is as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A transaction is <dfn title="transaction create">created</dfn> using 
              <a class="idlType" href="#widl-IDBDatabase-transaction">IDBDatabase.transaction</a>.
              The arguments passed determine the <a>scope</a> of the transaction and whether the transaction is read-only.
              When a transaction is created its <a>active</a> flag is initially set to true.
            </li>
            <li>
              The implementation MUST allow <a>request</a>s to be <a title="place request">placed</a> against the transaction
              whenever the <a>active</a> flag is true. This is the case even if the transaction has not yet been
              <a title="transaction start">started</a>. Until the transaction is <a title="transaction start">started</a>
              the implementation MUST NOT execute these requests; however, the implementation MUST keep track of the
              <a>request</a>s and their order. Requests may be placed against a transaction only while that transaction
              is <a>active</a>. If an attempt is made to place a request against a transaction when that transaction is not
              <a>active</a>, the implementation MUST reject the attempt by throwing a 
              <code>DOMException</code> of type <a><code>TransactionInactiveError</code></a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once an implementation is able to enforce the constraints defined for the transaction <a>mode</a>, defined below, 
              the implementation MUST queue up an operation to <dfn title="transaction start">start</dfn> the transaction asynchronously. 
              The timing for when this happens is affected by:
                <ul>
                  <li>The <a>mode</a> in which the transaction is opened.</li>
                  <li>Which <a>object store</a>s are included in the <a>scope</a> of the transaction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the transaction has been <a title="transaction start">started</a> the implementation can
              start executing the <a>request</a>s placed against the transaction. Unless otherwise defined, requests
              MUST be executed in the order in which they were made against the transaction. Likewise, their results MUST
              be returned in the order the requests were placed against a specific transaction.
              There is no guarantee about the order that results from requests in different transactions are returned.
              Similarly, the transaction <a>mode</a>s ensure that two requests placed against different transactions 
              can execute in any order without affecting what resulting data is stored in the database.
            </li>
            <li>
              A transaction can be <dfn title="abort">aborted</dfn> at any time before it is <a title="transaction finish">finished</a>, 
              even if the transaction isn't currently <a>active</a> or hasn't yet <a title="transaction start">started</a>. 
              When a transaction is aborted the implementation MUST undo (roll back) any changes
              that were made to the <a>database</a> during that transaction. This includes both changes to the contents of
              <a>object store</a>s as well as additions and removals of <a>object store</a>s and <a>index</a>es.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a transaction can no longer become <a>active</a>, the implementation MUST attempt to
              <dfn>commit</dfn> it, as long as the transaction has not been <a title="abort">aborted</a>. 
              This usually happens after all requests placed against the
              transaction have been executed and their returned results handled, and no new requests have been placed
              against the transaction. When a transaction is committed, the implementation MUST atomically write
              any changes to the <a>database</a> made by requests placed against the transaction. That is, either all
              of the changes MUST be written, or if an error occurs, such as a disk write error, the implementation
              MUST NOT write any of the changes to the database. If such an error occurs, the implementation MUST
              <a>abort</a> the transaction by following the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a>, otherwise it
              MUST <a>commit</a> the transaction by following the <a>steps for committing a transaction</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a transaction is <a>commit</a>ted or <a>abort</a>ed, it is said to be
              <def title="transaction finish">finished</def>. If a transaction can't be finished, for example
              due to the implementation crashing or the user taking some explicit action to cancel it, the
              implementation MUST <a>abort</a> the transaction.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Transactions are opened in one of three <dfn title="mode">modes</dfn>. The mode
            determines how concurrent access to <a>object store</a>s in the transaction are isolated.

          </ol>

          <p>
            The transaction <a>mode</a> controls whether or not multiple transactions can run currently 
            and which operations may be performed during the transaction.
            The allowed operations are defined in detail below, but in general
            transactions opened in <code><a>READ_ONLY</a></code> mode are only allowed to perform
            operations that do not change data. READ_WRITE transactions are allowed to
            read from and write to transactions to existing <a>object store</a>s, whereas
            VERSION_CHANGE transactions are allowed to perform any operations, including ones that
            delete and create <a>object store</a>s and <a>index</a>es.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A VERSION_CHANGE transaction can never run concurrently with other transactions. When
            a VERSION_CHANGE transaction is created, the implementation MUST wait to
            <a title="transaction start">start</a> the VERSION_CHANGE transaction until no other transactions
            against the same <a>database</a> are running. As long as the VERSION_CHANGE transaction is pending, the implementation
            MUST wait before <a title="transaction start">starting</a> any other transactions against the same <a>database</a>
            until the VERSION_CHANGE transaction is finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any number of transactions opened in <a>READ_ONLY</a> mode are allowed to run concurrently,
            even if the transaction's <a>scope</a> overlap and include the same <a>object store</a>s.
            As long as a READ_ONLY transaction is running, the data that the implementation returns
            through <a>request</a>s created with that transaction MUST remain
            constant. That is, two requests to read the same piece of data MUST yield the same result
            both for the case when data is found and the result is that data, and for the case when data
            is not found and a lack of data is indicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a number of ways that an implementation ensures this. The implementation can prevent any
            READ_WRITE transaction, whose scope overlaps the scope of the READ_ONLY transaction, from
            starting until the READ_ONLY transaction finishes. Or the implementation can allow the READ_ONLY
            transaction to see a snapshot of the contents of the <a>object store</a>s which is taken when
            the READ_ONLY transaction started.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, implementations MUST ensure that a READ_WRITE transaction is only affected by
            changes to <a>object store</a>s that are made using the transaction itself. For example, the
            implementation MUST ensure that another transaction does not modify the contents of
            <a>object store</a>s in the READ_WRITE transaction's <a>scope</a>. The implementation
            MUST also ensure that if the READ_WRITE transaction completes successfully, the
            changes written to <a>object store</a>s using the transaction can be committed to the
            <a>database</a> without merge conflicts. An implementation MUST NOT abort a transaction
            due to merge conflicts.
          </p>
          <p>
            An implementation MUST NOT start any transaction until all other READ_WRITE transactions
            with overlapping <a>scope</a> have completed. When multiple transactions are
            eligible to be started, older transactions SHOULD be started first.
          </p>
          <p>
            User agents MUST ensure a reasonable level of fairness across transactions to prevent
            starvation. For example, if multiple READ_ONLY transactions are started one after another
            the implementation MUST NOT indefinitely prevent a pending READ_WRITE
            transaction from <a title="transaction start">starting</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conforming user agents MUST automatically abort a <a>transaction</a> at
            the end of the scope in which it was created, if an exception is propagated to that scope.

            The steps set the <a>request transaction</a> to be that <a>transaction</a>.

            That function create requests which have a null <a>request transaction</a>.

          <h4>Cursor</h4>
          <p>
            <a title="cursor">Cursors</a> are a transient mechanism used to 
            iterate over multiple records in a database. 
            Storage operations are performed on the underlying <a>index</a> or an 
            <a>object store</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <dfn>cursor</dfn> comprises a <dfn>range</dfn> of records in either an <a>index</a>
            or an <a>object store</a>. The cursor has a <dfn title="cursor source">source</dfn> that indicates
            which index or object store is associated with the records over which the <a>cursor</a> is iterating. 
            A <a>cursor</a> maintains a <dfn>position</dfn> over 
            this series, which moves in a <dfn>direction</dfn> that is in either 
            monotonically increasing or decreasing order of the <a>record</a> keys. Cursors
            also have a <dfn title="cursor key">key</dfn> and a <dfn title="cursor value">value</dfn>
            which represent the <a>key</a> and the <a>value</a> of the last iterated <a>record</a>.
            Cursors finally have a <dfn>got value</dfn> flag. When this flag is false, the cursor is either
            in the process of loading the next value or it has reached the end of its <a>range</a>, when it
            is true, it indicates that the cursor is currently holding a value and that it is ready to iterate
            to the next one.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <a title="cursor source">source</a> of a cursor is an <a>object store</a>, the <dfn>effective object store</dfn>
            of the cursor is that object store and the <dfn>effective key</dfn> of the cursor is the cursor's <a>position</a>.
            If the <a title="cursor source">source</a> of a cursor is an <a>index</a>, the <a>effective object store</a>
            of the cursor is that index's <a>referenced</a> object store and the <a>effective key</a> is the cursor's
            <a>object store position</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible for the list of records which the cursor is iterating over to
            change before the full <a>range</a> of the cursor has been iterated. In order to
            handle this, cursors maintain their <a>position</a> not as an index, but rather
            as a <a>key</a> of the previously returned record. For a forward iterating cursor,
            the next time the cursor is asked to iterate to the next record it returns the
            record with the lowest <a>key</a> <a>greater than</a> the one previously returned. For
            a backwards iterating cursor, the situation is opposite and it returns the record
            with the highest <a>key</a> <a>less than</a> the one previously returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            For cursors iterating indexes the situation is a little bit more complicated since
            multiple records can have the same key and are therefore also sorted by <a>value</a>.
            When iterating indexes the <a>cursor</a> also has an <dfn>object store position</dfn>, which indicates
            the <a>value</a> of the previously found <a>record</a> in the index. Both
            <a>position</a> and the <a>object store position</a> are used when finding the next appropriate record.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a title="cursor">Cursor</a> objects implement the <a><code>IDBCursor</code></a> 
            or the <a><code>IDBCursorSync</code></a> interfaces. There is only ever one
            <a><code>IDBCursor</code></a> or <a><code>IDBCursorSync</code></a> instance representing
            a given <a>cursor</a>. However there is no limit on how many cursors can be used at the
            same time.
