        This document defines APIs for a database of records holding simple 
        values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key and some 
        value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records it stores. 
        An application developer directly uses an API to locate records either 
        by their key or by using an index. A query language can be layered on 
        this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a persistent 
        B-tree data structure.

      <h3>Constructs</h3>
        <p>
          An indexed database is made of records holding simple values
          and hierarchical objects. Each <dfn>record</dfn> consists of a key and a value. 
        </p>
        
        <section id="key-construct" class="section">
          <h4>Keys</h4>
          
          <p>
            In order to efficiently retrieve <a title="record">records</a> 
            stored in an indexed database, a user agent needs to organize each 
            <a>record</a> according to its key. <a>Conforming user agents</a>
            MUST support the use of the following values as keys: IDL data types
            <code>DOMString</code>, <code>long</code>, and <code>float</code> [[!WEBIDL]]; the <code>Date</code> JavaScript object [[!ECMA-262]]; as well as the value <code>null</code>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For purposes of comparison, all <code>DOMString</code> values are evaluated as greater than 
            <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>Date</code> values; <code>Date</code> values are evaluated as greater than <code>long</code> 
            and <code>float</code> values; and <code>long</code> and <code>float</code> values are evaluated by their numeric 
            value with no need to separate them by type. Moreover, <code>null</code> always evaluates 
            less than any other key value that is a non-null value. For the particular case 
            of floating point numbers, the value NaN is not allowed.
          </p>
          <div class="note">
            Only data types with natural ordering can be used as keys. 
            The ECMAScript <code>undefined</code> MUST NOT be used as a key.

        <section id="value-construct" class="section">
          <h4>Values</h4>
          <p>
            Values can be any data type supported by the <a>structured clone algorithm</a> 
            [[!HTML5]]. This includes simple types such as <code>DOMString</code>
            and <code>Date</code> as well as <code>Object</code> and <code>Array</code>
            instances.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A database can derive a key from the contents of
            the value being stored. In such a case, only <code>Object</code> 
            instances MAY be stored as values. Only the direct enumerable
            properties of a stored <code>Object</code> instance SHOULD be 
            used to derive a key value.

          <h4>Object Store</h4>
          <p>
            An <dfn>object store</dfn> is a persistent storage mechanism that 
            holds key-value pairs, also called <a title="record">records</a> 
            or <dfn>stored objects</dfn>. An <a>object store</a>'s 
            <a title="record">records</a> are sorted by keys to enable fast 
            insertion and look up as well as ordered retrieval. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Every <a>object store</a> has a 
            <dfn title="object store name">name</dfn>. Within a <a>database</a>, 
            each <a>object store</a> MUST have a <a title="valid-name">valid</a> 
            and unique <a title="object store name">name</a>. 
          </p>          
          <p>
            If an <a>object store</a> uses keys generated from a monotonically
            increasing sequence, it MUST have a <dfn>key generator</dfn> that 
            produces unique keys for <a title="record">records</a> in that 
            <a>object store</a>. Alternatively, if an application provides keys, 
            they MAY either be identified as a part of the value being stored, 
            also called <dfn>in-line keys</dfn>, or be identified separately, 
            also called <dfn>out-of-line keys</dfn>. No two 
            <a title="record">records</a> in an <a>object store</a> MAY be 
            identified by the same key. An <a>object store</a> MUST have a 
            <dfn title="object store key path">key path</dfn> if it uses 
            <a>in-line keys</a>. The <a>key path</a> MUST be the name 
            of an enumerated property of all stored objects in that 
            <a>object store</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Concurrent access to an <a>object store</a> MAY be isolated in one 
            of three <dfn title="mode">modes</dfn>. These are:
            <ol>
              <li><code>READ_ONLY</code></li>
              <li><code>READ_WRITE</code></li>
              <li><code>SNAPSHOT_READ</code></li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>  
            Any number of <a title="reader">readers</a> MAY concurrently access 
            an <a>object store</a>. A <a>writer</a> is not allowed
            if there is any <a>reader</a> concurrently accessing the 
            <a>object store</a>, unless the <a>reader</a> is detached, i.e., 
            looking at a snapshot view of the data that does not change once 
            created.

            If an <a>index</a> is <dfn>auto-populated</dfn>, then the user agent 
            populates records using the values stored in the <a>referenced</a> 
            <a>object store</a>. An <a>auto-populated</a> <a>index</a> MUST have

            MUST be the name of an enumerated property of every object to be

            <a>index</a>. The <a>auto-populated</a> <a>index</a> record
